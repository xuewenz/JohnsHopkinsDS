y_train = Data read from y_train.txt

subject_train = Data read from subject_train.txt


x_test = Data read from X_test.txt

y_test = Data read from y_test.txt

subject_test = Data read from subject_test.txt


features = Data read from features.txt

activity_labels = Data read from activity_labels.txt


TrainM = combine all the train variables (x_train,y_train and subject_train)

TestM = combine all the test variables (x_test,y_test and subject_test)

AllM = =Combined both TrainM and TestM


DesiredNamesIndex = The Index of desirable variable in the AllM dataset

DesiredData = The desired data for this project

DesiredDataWithActivityNames = DesiredData with Activity Name mapped

SecTidySet = Tidy set of Data!
